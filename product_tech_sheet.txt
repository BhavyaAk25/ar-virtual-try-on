Product Tech Sheet - 3D AR Jacket Try-On
=======================================

1. Plain-English Pitch
----------------------
Think of this app as a smart mirror that lets you "wear" a 3D jacket without touching the closet. You stand in front of your webcam and, within a second, a realistic jacket follows your shoulders, moves when you move, and keeps your face uncovered.

2. What You See When It Runs
----------------------------
- A webcam window opens with a light green stick-figure overlay that confirms the system sees your shoulders, hips, and face.
- A blue 3D jacket appears on your torso. It automatically grows or shrinks so it fits your body and adjusts when you walk closer or farther from the camera.
- On-screen text shows helpful reminders plus hotkeys. Tap `p` for a photo or `v` for a video - everything lands in the `captures/` folder.
- Use quick keys (`a/d/w/s/c/m/r`) to tweak scale, height, style, and reset without digging into code. Raise an open palm to cycle colors hands-free.
- Quit any time with `q`.

3. What You Need
----------------
- A laptop or desktop with Python 3.7+.
- Basic webcam (built-in cams are fine).
- macOS, Windows, or Linux. A GPU helps but is optional.
- Install once with `pip install -r requirements.txt` or run `setup.sh` to automate it.

4. Why It Feels Magical (Without The Jargon)
-------------------------------------------
- The app measures your body in pixels every single frame instead of assuming one body size. That is why the jacket always fits and keeps working as you move.
- It watches your mouth position so the jacket sits below your face, meaning no more AR clothing covering your smile.
- Real 3D lighting and perspective make the fabric look like it belongs in your room rather than being pasted on.

5. Tech Ingredients Explained Simply
------------------------------------
| Piece       | Plain-English Role |
|-------------|--------------------|
| OpenCV      | Turns on the camera and hands us each video frame.
| MediaPipe   | Spots 33 body points (shoulders, hips, face) so we know your shape and movements.
| NumPy       | Acts as our fast calculator for all those pixel measurements.
| Trimesh     | Opens and normalizes the 3D jacket file (`jacket.glb`).
| PyRender    | Paints and lights the 3D jacket so it looks real when placed over the video.

6. How A Frame Is Processed (Human Terms)
-----------------------------------------
1. Load the jacket model and set up lights.
2. Turn on the webcam and start reading frames.
3. MediaPipe draws a skeleton and tells us how wide your shoulders are and where your mouth sits.
4. We size and position the jacket using those numbers (no tape measure needed).
5. PyRender drops the jacket into the scene and blends it with the live video.
6. Repeat ~30 times per second so it feels instant.

7. Folder Cheat Sheet
---------------------
- `jacket_ar.py` - The main script; run this to launch the try-on experience.
- `jacket.glb` - The 3D jacket model (swap this to try other garments).
- `captures/` - Photos and MP4 videos saved whenever you press `p` or `v`.
- `assets/` - Supporting graphics and style files.
- `requirements.txt` - List of Python packages the installer uses.
- `README.md`, `QUICKSTART.md`, `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` - Deeper dives if you want to see the full technical story.
- `logs/` - Optional telemetry and debug info for developers.

8. What Makes It Stand Out
--------------------------
- True 3D rendering (not just pasting a flat PNG on your shirt).
- Automatically adapts to every body size and distance without calibration.
- Face-aware placement keeps expressions visible.
- Built-in control center (hotkeys + gestures) for easy, no-code adjustments.
- One-tap media capture for demos, social posts, and testing.

9. Typical Uses
---------------
- Showing a jacket in an online fashion store without shipping samples.
- In-store kiosks where shoppers can test looks safely.
- Social media AR effects for marketing launches.
- Design teams previewing new garments in motion.

10. Future-Friendly Ideas
-------------------------
- Swap jackets instantly from a menu of GLB files.
- Add pants, accessories, or full outfits.
- Gesture-only UI so you never touch the keyboard mid-demo.
- Built-in sharing button to push captures to social channels.

11. Quick Demo Script 
----------------------------------------
1. "Here is my laptop webcam. Stand where you would be for a selfie."
2. Run `python3 jacket_ar.py`.
3. "See the green skeleton? That means it understands your posture."
4. "Watch how the jacket moves and never hides your face."
5. Press `p` to grab a photo; show them the saved file in `captures/`.
6. Use `a` or `d` to resize live, and raise your palm to swap colors.

That is the whole story - simple enough for a friend, but still grounded in what the tech actually does.
